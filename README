    Locale::MakePhrase - rule-based language translation support


DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to solve one of the most perplexing problems
with multi-language support within programs -> the ability to
translate any input phrase (with or without arguments) into any
output phrase, by using a technique which I have coined the term
'linguistic rule evalution'.


DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is contained within the Perl POD format within
MakePhrase modules.


DEPENDENCIES

This group of modules requires:
  - perl 5.8 (since it uses UTF-8 internally)
  - I18N::LangTags 0.21

Optionally requires:
  - DBD::Pg for PostgreSQL database support


INSTALLATION

Usually you just need to do a:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

or, if you are retrieving this module using the CPAN command shell:

  cpan
  install Locale::MakePhrase
